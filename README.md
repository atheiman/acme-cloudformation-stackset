# Acme::CloudFormation::StackSet

This repo serves as an example of how to deploy [the CloudFormation resource `AWS::CloudFormation::StackSet`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudformation-stackset.html) to a GovCloud account, where the resource is not yet available. This is possible because the code for the `AWS::CloudFormation::StackSet` resource is open source, available at https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-resource-providers-cloudformation/tree/master/aws-cloudformation-stackset.
